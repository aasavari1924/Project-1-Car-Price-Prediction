📘 Introduction :

The automotive industry has witnessed significant growth in recent years, with the used car market playing a crucial role in this expansion. As more people seek cost-effective transportation solutions, the demand for reliable used vehicles continues to rise. However, determining the fair market value of a used car can be challenging due to the wide variation in vehicle conditions, brands, mileage, and other attributes.
This project, Car Price Prediction, aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of a used car based on its features. 

❗Problem Statement:

In the used car market, accurately determining the fair price of a vehicle is a challenging task due to numerous influencing factors such as brand, age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and overall condition. Buyers often risk overpaying for cars, while sellers may undervalue their vehicles due to a lack of data-driven insights.
Currently, price estimation relies heavily on subjective judgment or online listings, which can be inconsistent and misleading. There is a need for a reliable, automated system that can predict the resale value of used cars based on historical data and measurable features.

📊 Dataset Description:

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about various used cars listed for sale. Each record represents a car and includes features that influence its resale value. The goal is to predict the selling_price of the car based on these features.

📌 Dataset Summary:

Feature Name	Description
name:The name of the car (includes brand and model)
year:Year the car was manufactured
selling_price:Target variable – price at which the car is listed for sale (in ₹)
km_driven:Total kilometers driven by the car
fuel:Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, LPG, Electric)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data analysis was conducted to understand the structure, relationships, and patterns within the dataset. This step helped guide feature engineering and model selection by identifying which variables most strongly influence car prices.

✅ Conclusion:

The Car Price Prediction project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to estimate the resale value of used cars based on historical data and vehicle attributes. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and model building, the project achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting car prices.
